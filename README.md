# About

This project `thed0xmachine` is an application (built in python) that allows you to search for information about an individual using their username, email address (maybe), or phone number (maybe). This application is not limited to just checking usernames but will have many other features too in the future.

Note: This project is still in development and is not ready for use and the owner of this project [@FluffySnowman](https://github.com/FluffySnowman) is doing this as a side project and is not working on it full time.

The aim of this project is to achieve this with <b>no dependencies</b> and <b>no API keys</b> etc. and can be automated- as in it can be used to do a many things at once instead of using multiple different tools individually.

This program is for research and educational purposes. The owners, contributors or anyone affiliated with this project is not responsible for the misuse of this program or any damage caused by this program in any shape or form.
